# Playing-Cards-Classification---Efficient-Net

This is a practice project with PyTorch. I created a multi-class classification model using PyTorch to classify playing cards images

# Usage:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/shariqhameedca/Playing-Cards-Classification---Efficient-Net

2. Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/cards-image-datasetclassification

Save and extract the data in 'data' folder in the main folder

4. Go through the notebook
